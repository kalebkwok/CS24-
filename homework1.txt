C++ was created to support object-oritented programming(OPP)
An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem.
First:

Desing Concept:Decomposing the Problem 
Breaking down the problem you have into a few subtasks with even smaller substasks would help you reduce the possibility of 
making mistakes.

Information hiding: preconditions and postconditions
Only need to think about what the function does, not how the function does its work.
preconditions is a statement giving the condition that is required to be true when a function is called,
The function is not guaranteed to perform as it should unless the precondition is true.
postcondition is a statement describing what will be true when a function call is completed. (like describing how the correct 
answears look like)
(Always think about those aspects when we need to write the code)
